A powerful and intuitive WYSIWYG interface that allows anyone to create Machine Learning models!

The concept of AI-Blocs is to have a simple scene with draggable objects that have scripts attached to them. The model can be run directly on the editor or be exported to a standalone script that runs on Tensorflow.

Variables are parsed from python scripts and can be edited from the AI-Blocs properties panel.

### Install

The project requires python (https://www.python.org/) and tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) to run projects. You can still create and edit projects without these dependencies.

To run AI-Blocs, download the project archive and launch AI-Blocs.exe.

To run your model simply press the "Play" button and let the magic happen!
